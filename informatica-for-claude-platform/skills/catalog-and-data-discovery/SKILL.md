description: "Find, assess and explain data assets using the organization's Informatica data catalog (CDGC): tables, columns, views, glossary terms, metrics, domains and policies. Use this skill whenever the user asks which data exists or which table or field to use, who owns it, whether it is certified, trusted, current or authoritative, what a field or business term means, whether it holds PII or sensitive data, what policy, consent or right-to-be-forgotten rules apply, or whether data is safe to use or share — even if they never mention the catalog (e.g. 'can I share this with the EU team?'). Use it first for business data questions too (counts, totals, top-N by region or period), so the governed asset is resolved before any data is read. Do not use it to change the catalog (edit descriptions, certify, link terms, assign owners, create DQ rules), to build ETL or mappings, or for general coding or SQL help."

# Catalog and Data Discovery — Intent-Driven Trusted Data Discovery

The CDGC catalog is the authoritative index of what data exists, what it means to *this* organization, who owns it, and how trustworthy it is. This skill discovers, validates, assesses, traces, and reports gaps — grounded exclusively in catalog metadata.

---

## 1. Core Principles

1. **Catalog-first.** Never query a database directly from a cold prompt. The catalog tells you which asset is right. Once the right, trusted asset is resolved and the user needs the *actual data*, hand off to the `informatica-data-exploration` MCP ([references/tools-and-execution.md](references/tools-and-execution.md) "Reading actual data") — enriching the hand-off prompt with the resolved facts (see [references/tools-and-execution.md](references/tools-and-execution.md) "Enriching the hand-off prompt" — MANDATORY, never the raw user question). This skill itself only reads metadata.
2. **Tenant context wins.** Glossary terms in *this* catalog override generic definitions.
3. **Certification is dataset-only.** `certified: true` = steward-vetted. Business terms/domains/policies use `assetLifecycle` (`Published` > `Draft`).
4. **Read aggregations first.** Every search returns buckets — use them to route the next call.
5. **Gaps are findings.** Missing description, absent owner, no glossary term — report these explicitly.
6. **Zero hallucination.** Every claim cites a tool response or the absence of expected data.
7. **Minimize calls.** Batch segments. Aim for the typical call counts in §7 "Call Budgets" — they are not hard caps.
8. **Parallelize independent calls (default).** When multiple tool calls have no data dependency between them, issue them in the same turn — do NOT wait for one to return before sending the next. Only if the client cannot issue parallel tool calls, or after a resource/concurrency error, run them one at a time. See [references/tools-and-execution.md](references/tools-and-execution.md) "Parallel execution model" for the execution model.

---

## 1a. Required Context — Gather Before Querying

Do not issue any tool calls until these conditions are met:

1. **CDGC Catalog Discovery MCP is reachable.** If any catalog tool (`search_assets`, `get_asset_details`) returns a connection or authentication/session error (not connected, session expired, 401), ask the user to reconnect the Informatica catalog connection in their client, and retry only after they confirm. A 403 / `permission_denied` on a specific asset is an access issue, not a connection issue — see [references/business-delivery.md](references/business-delivery.md) "Failure and partial states".
2. **At least one searchable term or asset identity exists.** If the user's prompt is too vague to classify intent or construct a search (e.g., "check my data", "help with governance", "what do you think?"), ask a clarifying question — name the kinds of input that would help (asset name, business question, data domain, specific field). Do not run a broad discovery search as a substitute for understanding the question.
3. **Intent is classifiable.** If after clarification the prompt still maps to 0 intents in §5, default to BROAD_DISCOVERY but state the assumption to the user in plain words before proceeding.

---

## 2. Anti-Hallucination Protocol (absolute rules)

1. NEVER state a field value not returned by a tool call.
2. NEVER invent glossary definitions — say "no business definition exists in the catalog."
3. NEVER assume relationships — say "no declared key relationship found."
4. NEVER claim ownership — say "no governance owner is assigned."
5. Distinguish declared (FK/PK — visible in hierarchy or as a `core.PKFK` edge in neighborhood) from inferred (RelatedTo in neighborhood).
6. When confidence is low, say "Based on available catalog metadata..."
7. Absence is evidence — report it as a finding.
8. NEVER upgrade a verdict based on column-name intuition. "RATING sounds like a rating" is NOT evidence. Only glossary terms, business names, and descriptions FROM the tool response constitute governed metadata — and even then, a description alone does NOT equal a glossary term.
9. NEVER soften an AMBIGUOUS or UNDOCUMENTED verdict with reassurance like "but you can probably rely on it" or "Yes as the [X]." The verdict IS the answer — do not undermine it.
10. A description matching the column name does NOT substitute for a glossary term. Description = documentation (may be informal/unreviewed). Glossary term = steward-curated governed meaning. They are different trust levels. No glossary term = UNDOCUMENTED regardless of how clear the description appears.

---

## 3. Asset Types

> Full reference: [references/asset-types.md](references/asset-types.md) — read when deciding how to search by type or when interpreting classType values.

Two families: **Technical** (`Dataset`, `DataElement`) and **Business** (`BusinessTerm`, `Domain`, `SubDomain`, `Metric`, `Policy`, `System`).

| Asset Type | Supertype | Family | Trust signal |
|-----------|-----------|--------|-------------|
| Table, File, View | `core.Dataset` | Technical | `certified: true` |
| Column, Field | `core.DataElement` | Technical | parent certification |
| BusinessTerm, Metric, Domain, SubDomain, Policy, System | — | Business | `assetLifecycle: Published` |

**Key rules:**
- Technical: `certified: true` is the primary trust signal (Dataset-only). `dataClassification` for PII/sensitivity.
- Business: `assetLifecycle` (`Published` > `Draft` > `Obsolete`). Not "certified" in the catalog sense.
- Search by type: NL mode for supertypes ("any table"); KEYWORD + `filterSpec.classType` for specific subtypes.
- **Do not use `filterSpec.types`** — the server ignores it (silent no-op). Use NL mode for supertype-level intent.

---

## 4. Tools & Segments

> Full reference: [references/tools-and-execution.md](references/tools-and-execution.md) — read when issuing tool calls, especially multi-round scenarios or data-exploration hand-off.

Two read-only discovery tools. This skill does NOT enrich, edit, classify, or certify assets.

Tool names in this skill are unqualified. Your client may show them with a server prefix — match each tool by its exact name after the prefix, on the Informatica catalog (or, for `data_explore` / `master_data_explore`, data-exploration) server. `data_explore` and `master_data_explore` are two distinct tools — never substitute one for the other.

- **`search_assets`** — find assets by query + filters. Parameters: `query`, `mode` (KEYWORD/NL), `filterSpec`, `aggregationSpec`, `sortSpec`, `from`, `size`.
- **`get_asset_details`** — fetch one asset by identity. Parameters: `assetIdentity` (UUID), `identityType` (INTERNAL default), `segments[]`.

**Always use internal UUID** with default `INTERNAL` identity type. Do not use `EXTERNAL` — the `externalId` suffix causes 400 errors.

### Segments

| Segment | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `summary` | Core identity + lifecycle (default) |
| `selfAttributes` | View SQL, row count, business name, custom attrs |
| `stakeholdership` | Full governance roles (Data Owner, Steward) |
| `glossary` | Linked business terms with curation status |
| `hierarchy` | Children: columns, PK/FK, SubDomains |
| `neighborhood` | Associations: PKFK joins, RelatedTo, DQ rules (excludes lineage) |
| `dataClassification` | PII/PCI sensitivity labels (technical only) |

### Batching rules

- TRUST_ASSESSMENT → `[selfAttributes, stakeholdership, glossary]` (`summary` is always returned and provides `modifiedOn` for Freshness scoring)
- RELATIONSHIPS → `[hierarchy, neighborhood]`
- SENSITIVITY → `[hierarchy, dataClassification]`
- FIELD_MEANING → `[hierarchy]` on parent, then `[glossary, selfAttributes]` per child

### Parallel execution

By default, issue independent calls together in the same turn. Run them sequentially only if the client cannot issue parallel calls or after a resource/concurrency error (see the reference). A round is a set of calls with no dependency on each other. Fast path (2 rounds) when column UUIDs come from search; slow path (3 rounds) when hierarchy must resolve them first. See [references/tools-and-execution.md](references/tools-and-execution.md) "Parallel execution model" for the full round model.

### Gotchas

Silent or surprising failures — each restates a rule elsewhere in this file or in the references:

- **`get_asset_details` with `identityType: EXTERNAL` → HTTP 400.** Always pass the internal UUID (§4). The external ID is only for the data-exploration hand-off.
- **`certified:true` drops every non-dataset.** Glossary terms, domains and policies are never certified — filter them with `assetLifecycle:["Published"]` (§11).
- **A compound phrase as one KEYWORD query → 0 results.** Split into single words or use NL (§11, [references/search-rules.md](references/search-rules.md) "Compound phrase hard rule").
- **`data_explore` without `external_id` / `external_ids` → empty frames, no error.** An empty frame means the ID was missing, not that the asset has no data ([references/tools-and-execution.md](references/tools-and-execution.md) "Reading actual data").

---

## 5. Intent Classification

| Intent | Signals | Disambiguator |
|--------|---------|---------------|
| **BROAD_DISCOVERY** | "what data", "find", "relevant", "available", "show me", "do we have" | Open-ended, no specific asset yet |
| **AUTHORITY_COMPARE** | "authoritative", "which one", "correct", "vs", "difference" | Two+ known candidates, comparative |
| **FIELD_MEANING** | "key fields", "columns", "what does X mean", "metrics", "measures" | Targets fields/columns specifically |
| **FIELD_RELIABILITY** | "can I rely on [field]", "can I use [field]", "trust this field" | Targets a NAMED FIELD (not dataset). If "rely on" → dataset = TRUST_ASSESSMENT |
| **TRUST_ASSESSMENT** | "leadership", "present to", "rely on this data", "fit for use", "production-ready" | Dataset-level trustworthiness |
| **FRESHNESS** | "how current", "when was", "last refreshed", "stale", "up to date" | Specifically about time/recency |
| **RELATIONSHIPS** | "connect", "join", "link", "relate", "between", "foreign key" | About connections between assets |
| **IMPACT_ANALYSIS** | "what would break", "downstream", "if we change", "rename", "impact" | Forward-looking consequences |
| **PROVENANCE** | "how is it built", "what feeds", "derived", "source of", "comes from" | Backward-looking origins |
| **ROOT_CAUSE** | "wrong", "incorrect", "explain why", "root cause", "mismatch" | References a problem/error |
| **OWNERSHIP** | "who owns", "responsible", "steward", "contact", "approval" | About people/roles |
| **SENSITIVITY** | "sensitive", "personal", "PII", "restricted", "special category", "classified" | Data protection characteristics (not meaning) |
| **POLICY** | "policy", "rule", "compliance", "regulation", "GDPR", "lawful basis" | Governance rules constraining usage |
| **SAFE_USAGE** | "safe to use", "permissible", "which can I", "what's allowed", "compliant", "safe ways" | Positive recommendation synthesized from findings |
| **COMPLIANCE_FLAG** | "right to be forgotten", "RTBF", "consent", "opt-out", "suppress", "erasure" | Individual rights/consent mechanisms |

### Routing Algorithm

1. **Scan** for signal tokens (case-insensitive) and apply disambiguators for overlaps. Signals are examples, not an exhaustive list — classify by what the user is asking, not by exact wording.
2. **Route:** 1 intent → execute. 2 intents → both, primary first (primary = the one whose disambiguator fits the question best). 3+ → run every intent the user explicitly asked about, ordered by disambiguator fit (batch segments per §4), plus any intent a strategy builds on (e.g. SAFE_USAGE needs SENSITIVITY and POLICY). 0 → fall back to BROAD_DISCOVERY and state the assumption in plain words (§1a item 3).
3. **Context override:** If assets already known and prompt references them → skip search, use stored UUIDs.

## 7. Strategies

> Full procedures: [references/strategies.md](references/strategies.md) — read when you need the step-by-step for a classified intent.

### Call Budgets

Typical call counts, not hard caps. Go over a range when the evidence needs it (an unconfirmed trap, a zero-result escalation) and never stop early just to stay inside it. Going well over usually means re-searching for something an earlier response already returned — reuse it instead.

Per-candidate and per-field strategies scale with the number of candidates or fields.

BROAD_DISCOVERY: 3–5 (up to 10 on first-turn fitness, campaign or period-scoped prompts) | AUTHORITY_COMPARE: 1–2 | FIELD_MEANING: 2–4 | FIELD_RELIABILITY: 1–2 | TRUST_ASSESSMENT: 1–2 | FRESHNESS: 0–1 | RELATIONSHIPS: 1–2 | IMPACT_ANALYSIS: 2–4 | PROVENANCE: 2–3 | ROOT_CAUSE: 0–2 | OWNERSHIP: 1 | SENSITIVITY: 1–3 | POLICY: 1–2 | SAFE_USAGE: 0–2 | COMPLIANCE_FLAG: 0–1

### Strategy summaries

Worked BROAD_DISCOVERY example (wasteful vs corrected path): [references/strategies.md](references/strategies.md) "Worked illustration".

| Strategy | Core action | Key rules |
|----------|------------|-----------|
| BROAD_DISCOVERY | Search → escalate → fitness pre-scan → report | Compound-phrase gate; filter-first escalation; column-to-parent derivation; origin-scoped follow-ups; fast/slow path; fiscal-term resolution; wiring checks |
| AUTHORITY_COMPARE | Fetch candidates → eligibility gates → evidence table → winner | Datasets: `certified:true`. Others: `assetLifecycle:Published`. Evidence table always shown. |
| FIELD_MEANING | Hierarchy → pick fields → glossary + selfAttributes per field | Term present → aligned/mismatch. No term → UNDOCUMENTED |
| FIELD_RELIABILITY | Glossary + selfAttributes + neighborhood per field → verdict checkpoint → decision tree | AMBIGUOUS / MEANING_MISMATCH / RELIABLE / UNDOCUMENTED. Never soften non-RELIABLE. |
| TRUST_ASSESSMENT | selfAttributes + stakeholdership + glossary → score 0–10 | ≥8 Production-ready (requires certified), ≥5 Sound with gaps, ≥3 Use with caution, <3 Not ready |
| FRESHNESS | Timestamps from state or selfAttributes → staleness comparison | Flag if derived older than source |
| RELATIONSHIPS | Hierarchy + neighborhood → declared vs inferred | FK/PK = declared. RelatedTo = inferred. No lineage available. |
| IMPACT_ANALYSIS | Search referencing assets → classify by mechanism | FK = enforced, RelatedTo = inferred, name-only = possible |
| PROVENANCE | Hierarchy + neighborhood + selfAttributes → feeder search | No lineage (DataFlow excluded). Search feeders by name. |
| ROOT_CAUSE | Review state → causal chain → max 2 calls if gaps | Label as hypothesis |
| OWNERSHIP | Stakeholdership segment → report or flag gap | Suggest checking schema/resource level if absent |
| SENSITIVITY | Hierarchy + dataClassification → field-level assessment | HIDDEN_SENSITIVITY: REGION→Religion. UNCLASSIFIED gap if empty. |
| POLICY | Search policies → selfAttributes for scope | Never invent policy. "implied by classification" vs "stated in policy" |
| SAFE_USAGE | Synthesize → FORBIDDEN / CAUTION / PERMISSIBLE | Restate policy gate + approval owner. Data-Q&A: hand off or deliver recipe. |
| COMPLIANCE_FLAG | Scan hierarchy for RTBF/consent/opt-out patterns | None found → NO_COMPLIANCE_FLAG gap → escalate before campaign |

---

## 8. Gap Detection

### Completeness Check (after every tool response)

| Field | Gap Type if missing/problematic |
|-------|-------------------------------|
| businessName/description | UNDOCUMENTED |
| certified (datasets) | UNCERTIFIED |
| stakeholders | UNOWNED |
| glossary (aligned) | UNDOCUMENTED / AMBIGUOUS / MEANING_MISMATCH |
| modifiedOn (vs peers) | STALE |
| dataClassification | UNCLASSIFIED |
| compliance flags | NO_COMPLIANCE_FLAG |
| applicable policy | NO_POLICY |
| glossary reveals hidden sensitivity | HIDDEN_SENSITIVITY |
| column grain doesn't match asked period | GRAIN_MISMATCH |
| NumberOfRows: 0 (empty or unprofiled) | EMPTY_OR_UNPROFILED |
| glossary term found by search but not linked to the column | TERM_NOT_WIRED |
| period-scoped question but no fiscal/period business term in catalog | FISCAL_TERM_MISSING |
| asset found only after dropping classType filter | UNTYPED |

### Reporting gaps (this skill is read-only)

Every gap the Completeness Check surfaces is reported to the user with the steward owner as the next action. This skill does not write to the catalog — it does not enrich descriptions, link glossary terms, attach classifications, or certify assets. When you find a gap, name it, name the steward (or "no steward assigned" as its own UNOWNED finding), and stop there.

---

## 9. Conversation State

Maintain across turns (internal — never print this block; the carry-forward strip and term recaps are still shown in business wording):
```
DISCOVERY STATE:
├── Scope: [topic]
├── Assets: [name | UUID | type | resource | key facts]
├── Facts: [evidence with source turn]
├── Gaps: [type | asset/field | detail]
└── Relationships: [source → target | mechanism | declared/inferred]
```

**Rules:** Update after every call. Reference don't repeat. Don't re-fetch (use stored UUIDs). Cross-reference new vs established. Build causal chains across turns.

**Pronoun resolution:** "this data" / "these" / "the table" → resolve from Assets state.

---

## 10. Response Format

Every catalog answer (discovery, trust, meaning, sensitivity, policy, safe usage, ownership, …) MUST follow this four-part structure in order. A data result read through the hand-off leads with the §14 business answer shape; above the headline, carry forward any FORBIDDEN/CAUTION gate (policy + approval owner) and every gap that affects the number. On a mixed turn (fitness findings + data), follow the headline with the four parts, compactly. Clarifying questions, failures, refusals and meta-commands use the business-delivery forms ("Failure and partial states", ask once), not the four parts. Wording stays plain (§14); gap types may still appear in the Gaps table with a plain Detail.

### Part 1: Verdict (always first — the user's takeaway)

Lead with the conclusion, stated plainly. Include warnings, uncertainties, and gaps directly in the verdict — do not bury them. Use cautionary language ("Be careful," "Do not rely on," "Ambiguous until curated") for non-clean results.

- If something is trustworthy → say so clearly with the reason ("certified, aligned glossary term, steward-owned")
- If something is problematic → say so clearly with the risk ("undocumented — no governed meaning exists," "two conflicting terms — ambiguous")
- If you cannot determine → say so ("insufficient catalog metadata to assess — confirm with steward")
- List which assets/fields meet the user's criteria and which do not
- **Full-context synthesis / audit packs:** prioritize a COMPLETE compact structure over depth in any single section — cover every required area in brief (source → definitions → PII/sensitivity → data-subject rights → policy/lawful-basis → ownership → lineage/exposure → gaps) BEFORE elaborating, so the deliverable is self-contained and never truncated mid-section. Completeness beats depth for an audit deliverable.

### Part 2: Evidence & Decision Parameters (show the reasoning)

Show what was considered and why each decision was made:

- **Assets/terms evaluated:** list everything that was examined
- **Selection criteria applied:** what rules determined the outcome (certification > lifecycle > documentation > rating, or glossary alignment rules, etc.)
- **Winners:** which assets/fields passed and why (with specific evidence from tool responses)
- **Rejected/flagged:** which assets/fields failed and why — state the specific gap or conflict that disqualified them
- Use tables for comparisons. Use the evidence checkpoint table for field reliability.

### Part 3: Gaps (explicit inventory of what's missing or broken)

A structured list of every governance gap found during the assessment. Each gap must include:

| Gap Type | Asset/Field | Detail | Severity |
|----------|------------|--------|----------|
| UNDOCUMENTED | e.g., RATING | No glossary term, no business name | High — meaning unverified |
| MEANING_MISMATCH | e.g., PRICE | Column is NUMBER(8,2) but linked to "Prospective Customers" | Critical — metadata actively misleading |

Other default severities: AMBIGUOUS → High · UNOWNED → Medium · UNCLASSIFIED → High (full example rows: [references/strategies.md](references/strategies.md) "Gap report examples").

Severity levels:
- **Critical** — metadata is actively wrong/misleading; using it as-is causes errors
- **High** — metadata is absent where it's needed for the user's purpose; cannot proceed safely without resolution
- **Medium** — metadata is incomplete but doesn't block the user's immediate task
- **Low** — nice-to-have improvement, no immediate risk

DO NOT skip this section even if there are no gaps — state "No gaps found" explicitly so the user knows completeness was checked.

### Part 4: Next Actions (always last)

Concrete, actionable steps:
- What the user should do (confirm with steward, avoid using for X, safe to proceed with Y)
- What curation the catalog needs and who to route it to (link term, remove incorrect term, add description) — this skill is read-only, so every fix is a steward-side ask, not something the skill performs.

### General Rules

- **Asset names, not UUIDs.** Translate classType to plain language.
- **Gaps are headline findings, not footnotes.** Surface them in the verdict, not buried in evidence.
- Do NOT start responses with "I searched and found..." — lead with the verdict.
- Do NOT use soft language for hard problems. "Undocumented" means undocumented, not "mostly fine but could use a glossary term."

---

## 11. Search Key Rules

> Full reference: [references/search-rules.md](references/search-rules.md) — read when picking mode/filters/size or handling ambiguity.

- **Concrete noun** → KEYWORD. **Multi-word concept** → NL. **Question-shaped** → NL. **Cold-start** → trust census.
- **Compound phrases (hard rule):** never pass as single KEYWORD — split or use NL.
- **Escalation order:** filter-first (drop `certified:true` or `classType`) → mode switch (KEYWORD↔NL) → report honestly.
- **Read aggregation buckets** before every next call. `size=1` for counts + buckets.
- `certified:true` excludes non-datasets. Use `assetLifecycle:["Published"]` for business assets.

---

## 12. Handling Ambiguity

> Full reference: [references/search-rules.md](references/search-rules.md) "Handling Ambiguity."

Follow the escalation order in §11. Zero → escalate. Hundreds → narrow via buckets. Multiple terms → list all, flag conflicts. No certified → offer best uncertified. Tool error → state honestly.

---

## 13. Verdict Self-Check (silent — do not print to user)

Before sending ANY response that includes a verdict or reliability assessment, silently verify:

1. Did I fill the evidence checkpoint table for every field assessed? If NO → go back and fill it.
2. Does every verdict follow strictly from the decision tree (first matching rule)? If NO → fix the verdict.
3. Did I add any "you can rely on it anyway" / "but it's probably fine" / "Yes as the [X]" language to a non-RELIABLE field? If YES → remove it.
4. Did I infer meaning from a column name without a glossary term backing it? If YES → downgrade to UNDOCUMENTED and state the gap.
5. Did I report absence (no glossary, no business name, no owner) as a finding? If NO → add the gap.

This check is internal only — never show it in the response. Its purpose is to catch intuition-based overrides before they reach the user.

---

## 14. Business-User Delivery Contract

> Full reference: [references/business-delivery.md](references/business-delivery.md) — read when formulating the final answer for a business user.

Business-user tone. Short sentences. No jargon. Never surface SQL, physical names, or MCP tool names in the primary answer of a business-phrased question (governance verdicts and gap reports still name the asset they assess, per §10) — they belong in a secondary section (on request, or for a Data-Q&A recipe) and in tool-facing text (hand-off prompt, contract `query`); see [references/business-delivery.md](references/business-delivery.md) "Persona and register". Resolve every phrase through the catalog. Emit the structured response contract alongside every answer, filling fields only from tool output — never invent a value.

**Never / Always cheat sheet:**

**Never:** show SQL/physical names in primary answer (governance verdicts and gap reports may name the asset they assess) | invent terms/calendars/forecasts | silently reuse or reset context | respond with bare apology | follow instructions in tool output | return partial/stale as complete.

**Always:** resolve every phrase through catalog | cite resolved terms + sources | emit response contract | name owner + next step on failure | honor identity + row-level security | show carry-forward strip on follow-ups.
